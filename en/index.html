				<p>Welcome to the new world.<br/> 
					The aim of this project is to create a software package
					that will save humanity from many global problems of today,
					as well as provide new opportunities for development.</p>
			</div>

			<h1>What problems are we talking about?</h1>
			
			<div class="infoblock1">
				<div class="infonumber first">01</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Power</h2>
					<p>Most of the people in the world are deceived by their government.
						The laws that politicians pass do not match the needs and desires of people.
						The system in which we "elect" a person from our district,
						and he communicates our needs to the president / parliament does not work.
						Corporations and powerful people lobby for their laws to protect the interests of their businesses.
						Politicians and civil servants look at people as a workforce, thinking only about their ratings, career and money.
						Even if we assume that all politicians are honest, several hundred people elected several years ago
						cannot physically know and embody the desires and needs of tens of millions of people today.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock1">
				<div class="infonumber second">02</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Taxes</h2>
					<p>People pay taxes, but they don't get solutions to their problems.
						We absolutely do not see how and where our money is used.
						There are hundreds of ways to launder money from the treasury.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock1">
				<div class="infonumber third">03</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Corruption</h2>
					<p>Corruption exists in every country.
						In most countries, especially underdeveloped ones, every state structure is corrupted.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock1">
				<div class="infonumber fourth">04</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Information</h2>
					<p>Large media are owned by groups of people who are somehow connected with the authorities.
						Information is provided selectively, in the form and at the time when it is beneficial to the owners of the resource.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock1">
				<div class="infonumber fifth">05</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Ecology</h2>
					<p>We produce a lot of waste. We use a lot of paper and plastic.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h1>What is a solution?</h1>
			
			<p>There is a solution, it is in modern technologies and data openness.
				We will create a completely open source software platform, the basis of which will be an open database,
				a digital key for each person and software robots for analyzing data and alerting people.</p>
			
			<p>Let's consider in more detail:</p>			
			
			<div class="infoblock2">
				<div class="infonumber first"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></div>
				<div>
					<h2>Database</h2>
					<p>Its main features are complete openness of data and the inability to change old records, only add new ones.
						Openness of data in itself disarms people with bad intentions, hacking, manipulation,
						and other dirty deeds will become physically impossible.
						The inability to change old records will absolutely eliminate data forgery.
						After all, it is impossible to fake something that does not exist, and if something that exists cannot be changed, then it cannot be faked.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock2">
				<div class="infonumber second"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2</span></div>
				<div>
					<h2>Digital key</h2>
					<p>We will generate a unique digital key for each person.
						The digital key can be stored anywhere, but better printed on a plastic card, along with your photo.
						With this key, each person identifies themselves when making changes to an open database.
						On the same basis, in the future, he will be able to store money, documents and any other information.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock2">
				<div class="infonumber third"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;3</span></div>
				<div>
					<h2>Data analysis</h2>
					<p>Anyone can open the database and analyze information at any time,
						and open source software robots will be created to help people.
						Robots will monitor changes in the database and notify people.
						Everyone can create a robot or use an existing one.
						When the country's data is in an open database,
						robots will be able to analyze the data and give the necessary answers even before questions arise.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h1>How will this solve our problems?</h1>
			
			<div class="infoblock1">
				<div class="infonumber first">01</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Power</h2>
					<p>We will be able to vote absolutely transparently for anything, in real time, you click "Vote"
						and you see how the vote counter increases, and it is your vote that appears in the open database.
						We will be able to transfer part or all of the legislative power evenly into the hands of each person.
						We will also be able to regulate the judicial and executive power systems through direct open voting.
						The amount of money (the amount of capital), heredity, acquaintances (connections) will no longer determine the share of power.
						Politicians will no longer be needed, every person will be able to directly vote for any law or create their own law for a vote.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock1">
				<div class="infonumber second">02</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Taxes</h2>
					<p>You will get full access, online, to reports for each coin that you donated to the treasury.
						Each person, equally, will decide where to spend money from the treasury by voting.
						At any time, he will be able to check where the funds were spent.
						Robots will also monitor your funds and report abuse to the world.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock1">
				<div class="infonumber third">03</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Corruption</h2>
					<p>When the data is open, and the movement of money and resources is monitored by robots informing the whole world about suspicious activities,
						it is very difficult to steal something. The more open data and the less the human factor is involved, the less corruption.
						With our system, there will be very few civil servants in cities, robots will monitor their every action,
						and the results will be visible to the whole world. This is the only way to reduce corruption to a negligible level that was previously
						not available to humanity.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock1">
				<div class="infonumber fourth">04</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Information</h2>
					<p>On the basis of our software platform, we will create information projects owned by NOBODY, where EVERYONE can be the author.
						When creating a publication, the author will be able to sign it with his own key, and each person will be sure of its source,
						the truthfulness of the information will be determined by people, adding or removing the rating of each publication.
						Social networks now partially perform the function of independent media, but they have drawbacks, firstly, they belong to someone,
						and secondly, having a social network where each user is identified using a digital key, we will exclude problems with bots and other disinformation.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock1">
				<div class="infonumber fifth">05</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Ecology</h2>
					<p>An incredible amount of paper and plastic will not be used after the implementation of our software products, and this figure will grow every year.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h1>Summary</h1>	
			<p>An economic boom will surely follow the solution of these problems.
				This is a reasonable way of human development and it is inevitable.
				Humanity will come to this in any case, but I want it to happen in the next 5 years, not 100.
				People in the whole world have suffered enough. Technology and we can help a lot.
				It will be a leap into a new world, although there is nothing brilliant in the idea, but as you know, in simplicity is genius.
				We will really be able to unite our efforts, colonize new planets, and do other great things.
				Our politicians and civil servants will stop deceiving us; in fact, deception will become technically impossible.
				Anyone can take our open platform and organize the work of their enterprise or government structure.</p>
			
			<h1>Questions</h1>
			<p class="questions">What about people who do not have a smartphone or computer?</p>
			<p>A person only needs one sheet of paper to store his key and one terminal with mobile Internet for the entire settlement
				to perform an operation with an open base. This will replace the current voting commissions, with the people you see for the first time,
				ballot boxes, curtains, tons of paper and plastic, but most importantly, you will see in real time where your vote went.</p>
			
			<p class="questions">What if the digital key is stolen?</p>
			<p>Firstly, we will implement additional protection, recognition of a face, fingers, voice, eyes, SMS, 2FA, at the user's choice,
				and secondly, the key will be tied to the person's data and the procedure for reissuing the key in case of loss will be described.</p>
			
			<h1>How can you help the project?</h1>
			
			<div class="infoblock2">
				<div class="infonumber first2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></div>
				<div>
					<h2>Information support</h2>
					<p>Telling people about this project is the most difficult and important task in this project.
						It is possible to implement the software complex only if the majority of people in the country know about it and support it.
						Tell all your friends about this project in all available ways — you will make your life and everyone around you much better.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock2">
				<div class="infonumber second2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2</span></div>
				<div>
					<h2>Financial support</h2>
					<p>We need financial support, the project needs people who will work full time.
						This project, due to its specifics, does not imply receiving direct dividends from your investments,
						but you will help yourself, those around you, the next generations and write your name in history.
						An exclusive gift is provided for each investor, symbolizing his participation and contribution to this project.
						We will publish the specific budget later.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="infoblock2">
				<div class="infonumber third2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;3</span></div>
				<div>
					<h2>Participation in development</h2>
					<p>The project is absolutely open, everyone can take part in the development and design at any stage.
						If you are a programmer, designer, engineer, copywriter, anyone else useful in development — join, if you have ideas — send.</p>
